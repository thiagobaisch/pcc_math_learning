#Python lab studying
I setup the project to be imported into venv using pip install -e . , so you can import all modules inside "mathlearning" folder
The scripts folder can import, but cannot be imported. These are for scripts that are not supposed to be imported, but use reusable code.
The reusable code should go inside "src/mathlearning" so it can be easily imported using mathlearning.filename
